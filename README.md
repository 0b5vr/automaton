## What is this

Automaton is an animation engine for creative coding.
While you're doing creative coding, doing time-based animation by code sometimes causes you so much pain.
This project provides a framework and its GUI to connect your coding pieces with animations.

It's intended to be used in 64k intro, so I'm trying my best to make its footprint as small as possible.
The package [`automaton`](./packages/automaton) have a minimal set of features that is required to play animations and it does not have any dependencies.
The package [`automaton-with-gui`](./packages/automaton-with-gui) intended to be used in development stage is pretty big since it contains third party codes like React.
