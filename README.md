# AutomatonWIthGUI

WIP

### Q: what is this

AutomatonWithGUI is gonna be developed under this separated repository

See: [https://fms-cat.com/automaton](https://fms-cat.com/automaton)

### Q: but why

To concentrate on minimum build in the original repo
Also entire GUI is going to be implemented with React and TypeScript
It's a large refactor yay, previous code for GUI was hell
